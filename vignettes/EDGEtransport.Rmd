## Description

The input data preparation routine of EDGE-Transport produces transport detailed data compatible with the structure of REMIND. The code is provided as R package, while the input data is available upon request. The input data is necessary to run the package. The input data generation routine uses the functions provided in the [edgeTrpLib](https://github.com/pik-piam/edgeTrpLib) package.

## Usage

The package can be installed from PIK-PIAM following the indications reported [here](https://github.com/pik-piam/edgeTransport).

Data can be generated as follows:

`
generateEDGEdata(input_folder, output_folder, EDGE_scenario, REMIND_scenario, saveRDS = FALSE)
`

Where:

`input_folder` character string containing the path to the input data folder

`output_folder` character string containing the path where output is saved

`EDGE_scenario` character string containing the selected transport scenario. Options are: `ConvCase`, `ElecEra`, `HydrHype`, `ConvCaseWise`, `ElecEraWise`, `HydrHypeWise`

`REMIND_scenario` character string containing the selected SSP scenario. Options are: `SSP1`, `SSP2`, `SSP3`, `SSP4`, `SSP5`. By default, `SSP2` is selected

`saveRDS` logical. If `TRUE`, levels 0, 1 and 2 temporary output RDS files are saved. By default, the parameter is set to `FALSE`.

In order to produce a complete new input data set for REMIND, the function needs to run with all options of `EDGE_scenario`. Afterwards, the results have to be collected to produce [mrremind](https://github.com/pik-piam/mrremind)-compatible input data as follows:

`
collectScens(output_folder)
`

where `output_folder` is the folder where the mrremind-compatible input data is saved.

## Data generation structure

The package contains three levels of data wrangling.

* Level 0: this level performs the raw data loading and processing. The scripts in this level load input data such as: detailed historical demand, technology performances-load factor, intensity, value of time, capital and operating costs.
* Level 1: in this level the inconvenience costs and preference factors are calibrated on the historical transport demand. The calibrated preferences are then projected in time for technologies-vehicles-modes based on assumptions of the evolution of the transport system.
* Level 2: the future composition of the transport system is defined via a Weibull-based function. The total demand for transport is calculated via regressions. Data is then saved in the form of .csv files.

## Scenarios description

The data preparation routine allows to provide combinations of transport scenarios and macro-economic scenarios. The transport scenarios are characterized by a set of assumptions about technological development, evolution of preferences for technologies and transport modes, lifestyle changes, introduction of policy packages. The assumptions are reported in a set of switches reported in the mapping file `EDGEtransport/data-raw/EDGEscenario_description.csv`. An extensive description of the scenarios is provided here [CIT]. The scenario options are the following:

`ConvCase` stands for *Conventional Case*, represents a conventional case, internal combustion engines, no incentives to alternative vehicles.

`ElecEra` stands for *Electric Era* incentives to battery electric vehicles

`HydrHype`stands for *Hydrogen Hype* incentives to fuel cell electric vehicles, slow development of battery electric vehicles

The same scenarios can be run with the suffix `Wise` to introduce lifestyle changes on top of the assumptions of the corresponding baselines. Lifestyle changes concern: a more moderate growth of demand, an increased preference for public transport and non-motorized modes.

The macro-economic scenarios are based on the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways [see @riahi_shared_2017]. The entries that vary across scenarios are GDP and population projections. There are no assumptions specific to transport structure across the various SSPs.
